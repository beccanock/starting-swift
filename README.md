The goal of the workshop was to create something:
* **Functional** - not a "proof-of-concept" or "micro-app", an actual app
* **Polished** - proper loading indicators, error handling, fallbacks for missing data, etc.
* **Fun** - something you would actually want to build

## Additional Reading

This is a list of the articles, websites, books, etc. that served as inspiration for the materials in this workshop. They are great supplementary materials to continue your journey with Swift.
